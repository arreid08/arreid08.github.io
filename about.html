        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <div class="about">
            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>
            I am originally from Indiana. I was born and raised there. I went to
            Purdue University for Electrical and Computer Engineering
            Technology. Graduated with my BS in May 2005. I started full time
            with John Deere in May of 2005. I met my husband Jon at John Deere
            in 2008. We got married on 4/14/2012. I had my first baby, Lillian
            Lorraine Reid, on 8/20/2014. My second baby, Lucas Alan Reid, came
            on 8/22/2016. I love being a wife and a mother.
            </p>
            <h2>Currently:</h2>
            <p>
            I currently work at John Deere as an IT Business Analyst. I have
            been with JD since 2005. I am taking my first course in learning how
            to be a front and backend developer.
            </p>
            <h3>Future Goals:</h3>
            <p>
            I hope to work in a role where I can use my new skills to create
            amazing web pages and programs.
